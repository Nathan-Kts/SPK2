# SPK2

This code is a proof of concept of lattice-based cryptography combining multiple private keys to a single public key, thereby allowing all private keys to decrypt messages send using the unique public key.
This implemenation is only a proof of concept and needs optimisations and a proper security analysis to be usable.
